[NOTE]
====
Here only using subqueries I can output the expected result: a list of film titles. However, I wanted to add more details so a user can quickly identify what the table is showing. If I wanted to add a column with the name of the category, and category_id for example, it seems to me that the query would become much bigger, having to write more when the same result can be obtained with a join approach.

== Films rented by most profitable customer. You can use the customer table and payment table to find the most profitable customer ie the customer that has made the largest sum of payments

`*_Answer: step by step_*` 

Step 1: _Every query will be used as a filter in the `WHERE` clause. First I need to identify the `customer_id` of the customer that has made the largest sum of payments_

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    sum(amount)
FROM
    payment
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2 DESC
LIMIT
    1;
```

====
''''
====

Step 2: _Now I need to have a query that outputs only the `customer_id`. The previous query has two columns and it would not work to use it as a subquery. But I will use it to create the new query_

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            sum(amount)
        FROM
            payment
        GROUP BY
            1
        ORDER BY
            2 DESC
        LIMIT
            1

Step 3: _The previous query with the customer_id, will help me to find the `inventory_id` so we can reach the film titles. I will limit the `45 rows output` to 5 just for esthetic reasons_

```sql
SELECT
    inventory_id

    rental

    customer_id IN (
        SELECT
            customer_id

                    customer_id,

                FROM
                    payment
                GROUP BY
                    1
                ORDER BY
                    2 DESC
                LIMIT
                    1

Step 4: _Next I will output the `film_id`_

    inventory

Step 6: _To be able to obtain the customer_name, I need to recycle the `customer_id` query in step 2_


```sql
SELECT
    concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS customer_name
FROM
    customer
WHERE
    customer_id IN (
        SELECT
            customer_id
        FROM
            (
                SELECT
                    customer_id,
                    sum(amount)
                FROM
                    payment
                GROUP BY
                    1
                ORDER BY
                    2 DESC
                LIMIT
                    1

Step 7: _On the final query, I will insert in the `SELECT` statement the `customer_name` so we have a table with the rented films and the name of the person that rented them, in this case is our most profitable customer_
